Ethoscope Hardware
========================
This is the hardware repository of the [ethoscope platform](http://gilestrolab.github.io/ethoscope).
It contains 3d printable files and instructions that alltogether should be enough to build ethoscopes, arenas and modules.

Hardware is developed and maintained on [Onshape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents?filter=team&teamId=562b938ce4b0462e71ca0169&column=modifiedAt&order=desc).

The software repository lives [here](https://github.com/gilestrolab/ethoscope)



Organisation
==================
This repo is organized as follows:
There are  three main parts:
  * **core** refers to the bare ethoscope.
  * **arenas** are interchangeable support where experimental animals are tested
  * **modules** are additional pieces of hardware adding functionalities to the ethoscopes.
